    with the dots That are pink, white and red. Then we saw one kite bump On the head of her bed! Then those Things ran about With big
    bumps, jumps and kicks And with hops and big thumps And all kinds of bad tricks. And I said, “I do NOT like the way that they play!
    If Mother could see this, Oh, what would she say!” Then our fish said, “Look! Look!” And our fish shook with fear. “Your mother is on
    her way home! Do you hear? Oh, what will she do to us? What will she say? Oh, she will not like it To find us this way!” “So, DO
    something! Fast!” said the fish. “Do you hear! I saw her. Your mother! Your mother is near! So, as fast as you can, Think of
    something to do! You will have to get rid of Thing One and Thing Two!” So, as fast as I could, I went after my net. And I said,
    “With my net I can get them I bet. I bet, with my net, I can get those Things yet!” Then I let down my net. It came down the a PLOP!
    And I had them! At last! Those two Things had to stop. Then I said to the cat, “Now, you do as I say. You pack up those Things And
    you take them away!” “Oh dear!” said the cat. “You did not like our game... Oh dear. What shame! What a shame! What a shame!” Then
    he shut up the Things In the box with the hook. And the cat went away With a sad kind of look. “That is good said the fish.”He has
    gone away. Yes. But your mother will come. She will find this big mess! And this mess is so big And so deep and so tall, we can not
    pick it up. There is no way at all!” And THEN! Who was back in the house? Why, the cat! “Have no fear of this mess,” Said the Cat
    in the Hat. “I always pick up all my playthings And so... I will show you another good trick that I know!” Then we saw him pick up
    all the things that were down. He picked up the cake, And the rake, And the gown, And the milk, and the strings, And the books, and
    the dish, And the fan, and the cup, And the ship, and the fish. And he put them away. Then he said, “That is that.” And then he was
    gone, with the tip of his hat. Then our mother came in And said said to us two, “Did you have any fun? Tell me. What did you do?”
    And Sally and I did not know What to say. Should we tell her The things that went on there that day? She we tell her about it? Now,
    what SHOULD we do? Well... what would YOU do If you mother asked YOU?
